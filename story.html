<h2> My Internship Search for Summer of 2019 </h2>
<p>
Hi, my name's Ethan Burrell, I'm a sophomore EECS student at UC Berkeley. Like all my peers,
I was looking for a learning experience for my 13 week break from school from May to August
and initially had great trouble finding a position at first.
<br> <br>
I started off the fall semester by attending carrer fairs and networking events where I would
speak with recruiters and engineers from many very cool companies. At the end of these conversations
(the contents of the conversations usually revolved around my projects) I would hand them my resume
or they would ask for my email. I was over the moon when the latter happened, but realized something
interesting: no one would email me back.
<br> <br>
As finals for Fall 2018 approached and I had only heard (decisisions and interviews/challenges) from a
small subset of companies that I had applied to, I knew over the break I had to strategize on how to
change the outcome of a simple application.
<br> <br>
During my break, I realized that I was just applying for every position I could find online, and maybe I
should try and narrow down to companies that I had done relevant projects and research about. Here is where
I learned a lot. I do research about the consequqnces of the hot housing climate of the Bay Area and decided
to use this special knowledge for new companies to apply to. I found cool real-estate startups like Stessa,
WayPoint, and LocateAI (among others), and decided to put my application in for their jobs. Here, the responses
to my application went up dramatically. I also noticed if I wrote ~200 characters in the "Other Questions box",
I would much more likely get a response. With this knowledge that there were interns needed in the real estate tech
sector, I set off on interviews and my Spring Semester was off to an infinitely better start than the Fall one.
<br> <br>
I had always heard that interviewing is an art, and over the winter break I chose to read aricles and books on how to
do this better. By talking to so many firms in such a short period of time, I was able to read recruiters reactions
to my responses and fine tuned how my technical inspired interviews should have gone. Even though a lot of these companies
maybe did not have the resources to take on an intern, just having the opportunity to be in a real phone interview helped me
learn so much about the interviewing, recruitment, and technical screening processes.
<br> <br>
</p>
<h2> The Graphs </h2>
<p>
I made some graphs over my winter break so that I could roughly see where I was failing in the interview process. At first
it seemed like my initiial applicaiton would get no friction in the Application Tracking System, with some changes to my
resume I was able to fix this. Later in the Spring semster, I was able to get more responses to my application, then I realized
I needed to work on interviewing skills. This simple visualizer helped me spot some pitfalls in my self and helped me improve and learn
as a job-seeker. Here's how the chart works:
<br>
The graph shows a flow from the initiial application (company name) to the next step of the application process. As you can see, a lot
right to "Denied" (this process usually takes ~1-2 months). Other companies move to other categories, here's how we define them:
<br> <br>
<ul>
<li> <strong> Coding Challenge: </strong> An online assignment that tested some techinal skill: algorithms, math, or system design </li>
<li> <strong> Phone Screen: </strong> A call with a recruiter/engineer, I didn't keep track of how many I had for each company, just if I had one</li>
<li> <strong> Follow up: </strong> If a company sent an email asking for more information or other events (not a call or a challenge)</li>
<li> <strong> On-site: </strong> A meeting where I met a recruiter in person (usually at a companies HQ) </li>
<li> <strong> Offer: </strong> A company offered me a position for the summer!!! Woohoo </li>
<li> <strong> Withdrawal: </strong> I had recieved offers from companies that I prefered, so I withdrew my application from some companies </li>
<li> <strong> Accepted: </strong> Signing the paperwork for the summer! </li>

After creating that graph, I decided to aggregrate all of the different companies into one
graph. This is what I found most useful to helping me improve my process.
